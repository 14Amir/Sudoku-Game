# Sudoku-Game
This is a simple implementation of the Sudoku game  
Sudoku (Japanese: 数独) is a number table that is one of the best brain exercises and IQ boosters.
The most common type of sudoku is a 9x9 table, where the whole table is divided into 9 smaller 3x3 tables. In this table, some numbers are placed by default, and the rest of the numbers should be found by observing the following three rules:
• The first rule: numbers 1 to 9 should be placed in each row of the table without repetition.
• The second rule: numbers 1 to 9 should be placed in each column of the table without repetition.
• The third rule: in each 3x3 area, a table of numbers 1 to 9 should be placed without repetition.

Here, we have gone to one of the simplest types of implementation and the simplest type of algorithm for the constraint satisfaction problem, so that after converting the sudoku game with the help of the rules mentioned above into a constraint satisfaction problem, we can solve the numbers house by house. fill them and correct them with the help of backtracking, and finally, if the table is solvable according to the initial filled cells, display the output filled table, and otherwise, a message based on the non-solvability of the sudoku table to announce
